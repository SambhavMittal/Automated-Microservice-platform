# Automated Microservices Deployment & Observability Platform

## Project Overview

This project focuses on building a robust, automated platform for deploying and managing containerized microservices on Kubernetes (Amazon EKS), with a strong emphasis on observability, reliability, and security. The goal is to demonstrate a comprehensive understanding of DevOps practices, from infrastructure provisioning to application deployment, monitoring, and incident response.

## Key Features

* **Automated CI/CD Pipeline:** Implement a GitOps-driven CI/CD pipeline for seamless deployment of microservices to Kubernetes.
* **Kubernetes (EKS) Orchestration:** Utilize Amazon EKS for managing containerized workloads, ensuring high availability and scalability.
* **Real-time Data Streaming with Kafka:** Integrate Apache Kafka for collecting and streaming logs, metrics, and events from microservices.
* **Centralized Observability with Grafana:** Visualize application performance, infrastructure health, and business metrics using Grafana dashboards, fed by Kafka streams and CloudWatch.
* **Reduced Deployment Time & Downtime:** Achieve significant improvements in deployment efficiency and application availability through automation and intelligent deployment strategies.
* **Security Automation:** Incorporate security best practices into the CI/CD pipeline, including container image vulnerability scanning and secret management.
* **Architecture Bottleneck Identification:** Tools and processes to proactively identify and address performance bottlenecks within the microservices architecture.
* **Internal Application Focus:** Designed for managing the lifecycle of internal business-critical applications.

## Architecture

(Include a diagram here, e.g., using Mermaid.js syntax or a link to a separate image file. This diagram should show the flow from code commit -> CI/CD -> EKS -> Microservices -> Kafka -> Grafana, and integration with AWS services.)

**AWS Services Used:**
* **Amazon EKS:** Kubernetes cluster for container orchestration.
* **Amazon EC2:** Worker nodes for the EKS cluster, Jenkins/GitLab Runner.
* **Amazon VPC:** Isolated network environment for resources.
* **Amazon S3:** Storing build artifacts, Terraform state, and logs.
* **AWS IAM:** Managing user and service permissions securely.
* **AWS ALB (Application Load Balancer):** Distributing traffic to microservices.
* **Amazon Route 53:** DNS management for application endpoints.
* **Amazon CloudWatch:** Collecting logs and metrics from AWS services and applications.
* **AWS Lambda:** Event-driven functions for automation tasks (e.g., triggering alerts).
* **Amazon ECR (Elastic Container Registry):** Storing Docker images.
* **Amazon RDS (Relational Database Service):** Managed database for microservices (e.g., PostgreSQL).
* **Amazon DynamoDB:** NoSQL database for specific microservices (e.g., session management).
* **Amazon CloudFront:** Content Delivery Network (CDN) for accelerating application content.

* **Terraform (for IaC)**
* **Jenkins / GitLab CI/CD (or similar)**
* **Helm (for Kubernetes package management)**
* **Git**
* **Python**
* **Bash Scripting**
* **Linux**

## Setup and Deployment

(Provide high-level steps. Avoid sharing sensitive information.)

1.  **AWS Infrastructure Provisioning:**
    * Set up VPC, subnets, security groups, and an EKS cluster using Terraform.
    * Configure necessary IAM roles and policies.
2.  **CI/CD Pipeline Setup:**
    * Configure Jenkins/GitLab CI/CD runners on EC2.
    * Define pipeline stages for code build, containerization, image scanning, and deployment to EKS.
3.  **Microservice Deployment:**
    * Containerize sample microservices (e.g., using Dockerfiles).
    * Create Kubernetes manifests (Deployments, Services, Ingresses) or Helm charts.
    * Deploy microservices to the EKS cluster.
4.  **Kafka & Grafana Integration:**
    * Set up Kafka cluster (e.g., on EC2 or using MSK if demonstrating advanced usage).
    * Configure microservices to send logs/metrics to Kafka.
    * Deploy Grafana and configure data sources (e.g., Prometheus, CloudWatch, Kafka-based metrics).
    * Build relevant dashboards for application and infrastructure observability.

## Challenges & Solutions

* **Challenge:** Managing secrets securely in Kubernetes.
    * **Solution:** Implemented AWS Secrets Manager integration with Kubernetes, using external-secrets or similar.
* **Challenge:** Ensuring seamless data streaming from distributed microservices to Kafka.
    * **Solution:** Utilized a centralized logging agent (e.g., Fluent Bit, Logstash) within the Kubernetes cluster to collect logs and forward them to Kafka topics.
* **Challenge:** Minimizing deployment downtime during updates.
    * **Solution:** Employed Kubernetes rolling updates and blue/green deployment strategies through Helm charts and CI/CD pipeline logic.

## Future Enhancements

* Implement a service mesh (e.g., Istio) for advanced traffic management and security.
* Integrate a chaos engineering tool to test system resilience.
* Explore serverless deployment patterns for specific microservices using AWS Lambda and API Gateway.
* Automate cost optimization recommendations based on CloudWatch metrics.
